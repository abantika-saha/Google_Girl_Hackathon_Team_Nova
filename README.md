This project has been made by Team Nova for Google Girl Hackathon 2022.


**PROJECT NAME:** Amalgam

**TEAM MEMEBERS**: Sohini Bhattacharya, Abantika Saha, Ankita Shaw

**THEME:** Future of Learning

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:** Hybrid education models are being adopted across educational institutions post pandemic. As the name suggests, this model gives students the flexibility to attend classes in both online and offline modes. Since educators have a mix of online and offline students to address, various novel methods or tools for teaching need to be adopted. Monitoring, doubt sessions, intra student communication, grading group projects etc are getting tougher and a 'standard' solution to this problem needs to be identified. What features could help solve for the Hybrid education model in the current day and age.

**BASIC DESCRIPTION:** We are building a web application which will be an effective learning application where faculty, students will meet, work together, share resources and have grading methodologies via tests/quizzes/assignments in one central location.
